    <p>Beyond coding, I find joy in the rhythm of shuttlecocks and strings. Whether engaging in a spirited
        badminton match or strumming melodies on the guitar, these leisure pursuits provide a perfect balance.
        Badminton keeps me active and focused, while the guitar allows me to unwind and express creativity. These
        hobbies not only recharge my energy but also contribute to a well-rounded perspective, enriching both my
        personal and professional life.</p>
